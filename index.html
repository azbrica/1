[00:07.00]I could walk you by, and I'll tell without a thought
[00:12.00]You'd be mine
[00:15.00]Would you mind if I took your hand tonight
[00:20.00]Know you're all that I want this life
[00:25.00]I'll imagine we fell in love
[00:29.00]I'll nap under moonlight skies with you
[00:34.00]I think I'll picture us, you with the waves
[00:39.00]The oceans colors on your face
[00:43.00]I'll leave my heart with your air
[00:47.00]So let me fly with you
[00:51.00]Will you be forever with me
[00:56.00][Guitar]
[01:25.00]My love will always stay by you
[01:30.00]I'll keep it safe so don't you worry a thing,
[01:35.00]I'll tell you I love you more
[01:40.00]It's stuck with you forever so promise you won't let it go
[01:46.00]I'll trust the universe will always bring me to you
[01:52.00]I'll imagine we fell in love
[01:56.00]I'll nap under moonlight skies with you
[02:00.00]I think I'll picture us, you with the waves
[02:05.00]The oceans colors on your face
